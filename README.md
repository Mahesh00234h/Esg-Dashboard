# Esg-Dashboard
# ESG Data Dashboard

This project provides an interactive web-based dashboard to visualize Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) data. Users can explore ESG indicators across countries and compare them over time.

## Features

- **Interactive World Map**: Visualize ESG scores by country.
- **Dynamic Filters**: Filter data by ESG category and year.
- **Comparative Bar Charts**: Compare ESG scores of different countries.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Built with Dash and Plotly for seamless user interaction.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Required Python libraries:
  - Dash
  - pandas
  - Plotly

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mahesh0023h/esg-dashboard.git
   cd esg-dashboard
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure the data file (`data/processed_esg_data.csv`) is in the `data` directory.

## Usage

1. Start the Dash app:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided by the terminal (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8050`).

3. Use the dropdown menus to select an ESG category and year to update the visualizations dynamically.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project should include:

- **Country Name**: The full name of the country.
- **Country Code**: The ISO code for the country.
- **Indicator Name\_x**: ESG indicator name.
- **Indicator Code**: Unique code for each ESG indicator.
- **Year Columns**: Sales data for specific years (e.g., `2010`, `2011`, etc.).

Ensure the data is cleaned and formatted correctly to avoid errors.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more ESG indicators for better analysis.
- Enable real-time data updates via APIs.
- Add advanced visualizations like trend lines and scatter plots.
- Provide the ability to download filtered data as CSV.
